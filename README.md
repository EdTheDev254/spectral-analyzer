# spectral-analyzer
I know some great developers have already built audio spectral viewers, but I wanna build one step by step....

# How to run it

At the moment before the UI update(still working on it)

```
python main.py 

#this will create an audio version of your image
```

# Reverse(Audio to Image-spectrogram)
This uses Matplotlib to show the spectrum from the audio.

```
python test-visual.py
```
